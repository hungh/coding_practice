/*
6-10. [4] Let G = (V,E) be an undirected graph. A set F âŠ† E of edges is called a
feedback-edge set if every cycle of G has at least one edge in F.

	(a) Suppose that G is unweighted. Design an efficient algorithm to find a
	 	minimum-size feedback-edge set.

	(b) Suppose that G is a weighted undirected graph with positive edge weights.
	    Design an efficient algorithm to find a minimum-weight feedback-edge set.

Analysis:
---------
The above problem is the same as:
(*) Input Description: A (directed) graph G=(V,E).
(*) Problem: What is the smallest set of edges E' or vertices V' whose deletion leaves an acyclic graph?
Solution: 
a. F is the compliment graph of G's MST
b. F is the complement graph of G's maximum weighted spanning tree (by converting all E of G weights to negatives)
