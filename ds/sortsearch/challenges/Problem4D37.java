/*
4-37. Implement versions of several different sorting algorithms,
 such as selection sort, insertion sort, heapsort, mergesort, and quicksort.
 Conduct experiments to assess the relative performance of these algorithms in 
 a simple application that reads a large text file and reports exactly one instance of each word that 
 appears within it. 
 This application can be efficiently implemented by sorting all the words that occur in the text and then passing through 
 the sorted sequence to identify one instance of each distinct word. Write a brief report with your conclusions.

 // I only implement merge sort to sort a large text file 
 // write it into a disk
 // read the sorted file to scan for each instance of words in the file

 // assume that we have limited memory size 
 // text is from http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2600/2600-0.txt
